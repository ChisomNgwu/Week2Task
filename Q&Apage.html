            <h1><i>Question.1</i><br>
            What distinguishes normal HTML elements from semantic HTML elements?
            </h1>
            <!--answers goes here-->
            <ol>
                <li>In HTML, semantic elements are those that convey meaning to both the browser and the developer.<br>
                     They provide a clear structure and context for the content they contain
                     A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.<br>
                         These elements clearly defines its content. In other terms semantic tags are those tags whose<br>
                          name can easily let you know which type of content take place in it. eg.<br>
                           < header >, < article> and < footer >.< footer >. </li>
                           <li>
                            On the other hand, non-semantic elements are those that do not inherently<br>
                             convey any meaning about the content they contain.
                            Normal HTML element are the element which Tells nothing about its content.<br> 
                            In other terms element whose name doesn't suggest you what they do. e.g. < div > and < span >.
                           </li>
                           <li>
                            The main difference between the two is that semantic elements provide meaning and context to the content,<br>
                             while non-semantic elements are primarily used for structure and styling. Using semantic elements can improve accessibility,<br> 
                             search engine optimization, and the overall organization of the HTML document.

            <h1><i>Question.2</i><br>
                Explain the disparity between closing tags and self-closing tags in HTML.</h1>
            <ul>
                <!--answers goes here-->
                <li>In HTML, a closing tag is an instructional piece of code that ends a section of page content. It's nearly the same as an opening tag<br> 
                    (e.g., "< p>") but it has a forward slash (e.g., "< /p>") to let browsers know where to start and end different elements<br> 
                    Without tags, the code might alter formatting or cause HTTP links to run into each other. 

                    Here's a syntax example with an opening and closing tag:<br> 
                    
                    < p > This is a paragraph in HTML.< /p >
                    
                    Some tags serve both as opening and closing tags.<br>
                     These are called self-closing tags, which you can use for shorter elements
                    such as horizontal rule breaks, line breaks, and images.<br> 
                    
                    Here are some examples of self-closing tag syntax:
                    
                        < img /> 
                        < br /> 
                        < hr />
                    
                    HTML tags give you more control over your web designs, including nesting elements.<br>
                     You can include an < img /> within a < p > and </ p >, for example.<br> 
                     In Webflow, you can input custom HTML code like semantic tags to adjust elements to your liking.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1><i>Question.3</i><br>
            What distinguishes inline elements from block elements in HTML?
            </h1>
            <!--answers goes here-->
            <ol>
                <li>
                    A block element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.<br>
                    An inline element does not start on a new line.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).<br>
                    An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The < p> element is a block-level element.<br>
                        The < div> element is a block-level element.<br> 
                        The < span> element is an inline element.
                </li>
            </ol>
